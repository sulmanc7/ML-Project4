Machine Learning Project 4

Dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/fedesoriano/stroke-prediction-dataset

Our group is using a dataset from Kaggle that holds 10 features including age, marital status, smoking status, and more to predict whether or not an individual has a stroke. To preprocess, we will clean the dataset using Pandas. During this, we will drop unecessary columns and null values. We will also use One Hot Encoding for character values and scale the data. From there, we will create a supervised machine learning model. To do this, we will use logistic regression, RandomForest, and KNN. To visualize the data, we will pull the dataset into Tableau and provide visuals of the attributes themselves, as well as their relationships to whether or not an individual has a stroke.
